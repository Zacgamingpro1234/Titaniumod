# Titanium  
A mod that optimizes stuff outside of Minecraft.  
  
### Will make a wiki for config soon
  
  
This mod is still in beta soooo maybe crashes? idk Probably not. Will probably stay on only optimizing Windows 10. (Please check the compatibility chart for info).  
Right now what it does it sets the game priority to high on startup and sets it normal upon closing the game. You can change the priority in the config. Also Priorities are in numbers so here's a small diagram:
  
  
low: 64   
below normal: 16384  
normal: 32  
above normal: 32768  
high priority: 128  
real time: 256
